### Project Overview
The main purpose of this project is to translate research material used to describe a spatial problem into a conceptual model of the problem in GIS. It includes determining a conceptual geoprocessing model prior to beginning work and finalizing the documentation of the implemented geoprocessing model. All work/data for this project is saved in a geodatabase.
